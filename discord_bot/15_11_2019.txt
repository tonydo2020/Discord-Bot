busting
questions
for
the
professor
lol
Society
we
live
in
do
we
need
to
ask
questions
Yeah
how
many
I
thought
it
was
extra
points
for
asking
questions
Oh
I
cant
remember
i
think
maximum
is
5
questions
per
rperson
that
means
5
points
max
is
it
req
or
is
it
5
pts
of
extra
credit
max
5
pts
not
worth
i
believe
he
said
something
like
one
point
per
day
it's
like
if
u
aske
questions
in
one
day,
you
only
get
the
points
for
one
question
i
don't
remember
exactly

probably
just
work
in
industry
and
make
tons
of
$$$
I
mean
I
don't
even
think
he
likes
teaching...
I
think
he
was
hoping
for
more
of
being
a
research
professor
more
than
an
actual
professor
:o
he's
here
for
research
money
Yeah
does
csuf
even
do
that
much
research?
Ya
they
approved
his
research
program
so
he's
funded
Not
that
much
as
compared
to
other
universities
probably
what
research
is
he
doing?
was
it
that
earthquake

I’m
cry
when
even
chris
is
looking
at
the
time
He’s
maybe
deciding
who
to
pick?
I
thought
he
had
a
list?
because
he
keeps
referencing
the
paper
he
has
before
he
calls
someone
just
to
pick
names
i
guess
He
has
his
phone
out.
Probably
doing
a
table
number
generator
Maybe
picking
ppl
that
have
projects
oh
Random*
